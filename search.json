In this role, I lead the development and deployment of computational methods that drive the identification of novel drug targets, while also building target confidence across pre-clinical and clinical programmes.\nPreviously, as a Senior Research Associate at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, I applied statistical genomics methods such as Mendelian Randomisation to discover and prioritise drug targets for neurological disorders, leveraging large-scale GWAS and proteomic datasets.\nI have also worked with malaria and viral epidemiology research groups at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, where I contributed to the development of bioinformatics and AI-driven approaches across genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics — deepening our understanding of human host immunology and pathogen biology. In parallel, I hold an Adjunct Faculty position at Pwani University, Kenya. My research interests lie at the intersection of single-cell and spatial technologies, artificial intelligence, and oncology drug discovery — fields I continue to pursue with both rigour and curiosity."
