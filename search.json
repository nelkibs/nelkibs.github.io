    "text": "I am a senior scientist trained in computational biology, currently working for Orion Pharma in Finland, where I contribute to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics in oncology medicine addressing critical unmet needs for cancer patients worldwide. In this role, I lead the development and deployment of computational methods that drive the identification of novel drug targets, while also building target confidence and patient stratification criteria across pre-clinical and clinical programmes.\nPreviously, as a Senior Research Associate at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, I applied statistical genomics methods such as Mendelian Randomization to discover and prioritise drug targets for neurological disorders, leveraging large-scale GWAS and proteomic datasets.\nI also worked with malaria and viral epidemiology research groups at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, where I contributed to the development of bioinformatics and AI-driven approaches across genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics — deepening our understanding of development of human host immunology against malaria parasites.\nIn parallel, I hold an Adjunct Faculty position at Pwani University, Kenya.\nMy current research interest lies at the intersection of single-cell and spatial technologies, artificial intelligence, and oncology drug discovery; fields I continue to pursue with rigour and curiosity."
